==> ANALYSIS OF Task0.py
time complexity is O(1).
Reason:- Because there are only print statements

==> ANALYSIS OF Task1.py
time complexity is O(n).
Reason:- Because there are two for loops iterating n times but as 2 is constant we can ignore it.

==> ANALYSIS OF Task2.py
time complexity is O(n).
Reason:- Because there are three for loops iterating n times but as 3 is constant we can ignore it.

==>ANALYSIS OF Task3.py
time complexity is O(n).
Reason:- Because there are two for loops iterating n times but as 2 is constant we can ignore it.

==>ANALYSIS OF Task4.py
time complexity is O(n).
Reason:- Because there are two for loops iterating n times but as 2 is constant we can ignore it.
